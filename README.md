# DMTQResearch
This project was dated back in 2016 when the game's account system was on a buggy migration and I lost access to my own account and thus was forced to implement a private server to access the game content. Things might be a bit dated but the core is still perfectly valid, in newer game versions API endpoint has a different URL and the rest is exactly the same. People who would like to continue working on this can start by reversing the dll of the Android version.

Thanks for two years of fun.
