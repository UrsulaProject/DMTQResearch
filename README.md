# DMTQResearch
This project was dated back in 2016 when the game's account system was on a buggy migration and I lost access to my own account and thus was forced to implement a private server to access the game content. Things might be a bit dated but the core is still perfectly valid, in newer game versions API endpoint has a different URL and the rest is exactly the same. People who would like to continue working on this can start by reversing the dll of the Android version.

Thanks for two years of fun.

# Patterns
Patterns are stored in ``DMTQ-server/dmtq/dmqglb.mb.pmang.com/DMQ/Patterns/``
``Patterns/SONGID/PatternID`` contains the outdated version of pattern collection and should be ignored
If the pattern is for EarphoneMode, then filename has `_EARPHONE` as suffix


# Full Package
Song data and BGAs are missing from this repo due to copyright reasons. You should be able to find a full release with the last known working private server implementation on that PT which name begins with a B and ends with an S or from a obscure place in this repo. From there you can port/fix it to the final version. This repo is only for archiving purposes
